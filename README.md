# Mercury (Discord API Module Framework and Bot Orchestrator)

This is a framework for developing systems using the Discord API (based on [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA)) which uses sideloaded module jars for customization.
It was build with the intent to orchestrate multiple (20+) Discord application instances at the same time. This can be used
for avoiding rate-limits (as they are only per application and not per ip), as well as for handling multiple voice channels
in one single guild.

**By no means is this a finished product or will ever become one. Seriously, please don't use this :)**

Unless anybody wants to develop this actively, this project is archived.
